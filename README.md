# Brain-Tumour-MRI-analysis-
This repository contains the implementation of a brain tumor detection model using OpenCV and machine learning techniques. The model is capable of reading medical images and identifying tumor regions.

Features

Image Processing: Utilizes OpenCV for preprocessing and enhancing medical images.

Tumor Detection: Employs a trained machine learning model to detect brain tumors in MRI or CT images.

User-Friendly: Easy-to-use notebook format for testing and modifying the model.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Place your medical images in the input_images/ folder.

Open the Jupyter notebook Brain_Tumor_Detection.ipynb.

Run the notebook step-by-step to process the images and detect tumors.

The output, including segmented images highlighting tumor regions, will be saved in the output_images/ folder.

Model Details

Frameworks: OpenCV, scikit-learn

Preprocessing: Includes grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and noise reduction.

Training Data: The model is trained on a dataset of labeled brain MRI images.

Algorithm: Utilizes [specific algorithm or model, e.g., Random Forest, CNN].

Future Work

Extend the model to detect multiple diseases such as pneumonia.

Develop a comprehensive segmentation model for multi-disease detection.

Integrate interpretability tools for better medical insights.
