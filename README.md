# Brain-Tumour-MRI-analysis-
This repository contains the implementation of a brain tumor detection model using OpenCV and machine learning techniques. The model is capable of reading medical images and identifying tumor regions.

**Features**

Image Processing: Utilizes OpenCV for preprocessing and enhancing medical images.

Tumor Detection: Employs a trained machine learning model to detect brain tumors in MRI or CT images.

User-Friendly: Easy-to-use notebook format for testing and modifying the model.

**Installation**

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
